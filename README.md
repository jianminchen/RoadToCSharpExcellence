# RoadToCSharpExcellence
Prepare to be a master of C# programming language. How to prepare in more efficient ways? 
I like to document my growth as a C# programmer. I like to rate myself comfortably 8 or 9 using 1 to 10 ranking, 
if 6 is the minimum to practice C# as a professional programmer. Extra 2 points I like to work on are C# code standards, 
object oriented programming, C# advanced features, C# common interview questions, from my viewpoints today 8/31/2017. 

I have been working on C# programming since June 2010 in the city of Vancouver, full time software developer working for
a small manufacturer company called MP Lighting Inc. 

I like to set up a goal to improve my C# programming day by day. 

Here is the blog I documented how I learn C# by reading a book C# tutorial:
