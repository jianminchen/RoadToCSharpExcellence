**Road To CSharp Excellence**


Prepare to be a master of C# programming language. How to prepare in more efficient ways? 
I like to document my growth as a C# programmer. I like to rate myself comfortably 8 or 9 using 1 to 10 ranking, 
if 6 is the minimum to practice C# as a professional programmer. Extra 2 points I like to work on are C# code standards, 
object oriented programming, C# advanced features, C# common interview questions, from my viewpoints today 8/31/2017. 

I have been working on C# programming since June 2010 in the city of Vancouver, full time software developer working for
a small manufacturer company called MP Lighting Inc. 

I like to set up a goal to improve my C# programming day by day. 

[Here](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2017/09/c-tutorial.html) is the blog I documented how I learn C# by reading a book C# tutorial:<br>
[Here](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/search?q=C%23+2000+things) are the blogs I wrote related to C# 2000 things. <br><br>
**Dec. 17, 2018**<br>
I plan to take some C# courses when I have one hour or two on LinkedIn learning, the detail is documented in the blog.
