I wrote a sudoku solver algorithm, and I asked myself if HashSet class has a Remove API or not. I know that it is time for me to memorize all API of HashSet<char>. 
Here is my Sudoku solver practice.

It is my over 10th practice. It feels so good since I can memorize the solution so clearly for each step including backtracking, recursive, and also every variable name I should declare. Practice often definitely helps me to gain confidence on this classical algorithm.

I start to read HashSet class and learn things quickly. I also had chance to go over interface IEqualityComparer with an example:
